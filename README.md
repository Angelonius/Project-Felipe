# Project-Felipe
This is a mod for UnCiv where I add the Philippines as led by it's first king, Felipe I (a.k.a Felipe II of Spain).

Disclaimer: In this mod, the Philippines is led by a Spanish Habsburg. This is because the Philippines was ruled as a separate crown by the Spanish. This is not an endorsement for Spanish irredentist claims on the Philippines.
